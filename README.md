# Rental Car App

This repo is my trial tech task, a part of Career Skills module of Full Stack Developer training.

It's a Front End part of "RentalCar" web-application, which purpose is to display customer a catalog of cars available for renting with filtering and sorting options.

## Tech Stack

JavaScript, HTML+CSS, React + Vite, Redux Toolkit, Axios, and more.

# The info about React + Vite template used to start the project:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
